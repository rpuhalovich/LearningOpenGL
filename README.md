# LearningOpenGL

This is a sandbox repository for me to play with OpenGL. I'm currently following the online book: https://learnopengl.com/

### Getting Started

Use ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/rpuhalovich/LearningOpenGL.git``` to clone. 

Use ```cmake -S . -B build -GXcode``` or ```cmake -S . -B build``` for Xcode and Visual Studio respectively. Or use either of the scripts found in the ```scripts/``` folder to build.
